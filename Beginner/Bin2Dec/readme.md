## Bin2Dec
***
Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on. Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2, mathematics. **The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and understanding of how binary calculations.**

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:

Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function to use.

## Users Story
***
*  User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
* User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
* User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered
